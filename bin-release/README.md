## About Flixel and Flixel Community##

[Flixel](http://flixel.org) is a well known open source and free game engine created by [Adam “Atomic” Saltsman](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel). Flixel has been used in hundreds of games, including IGF nominees, Adult Swim games, and avant-garde experiments. Many Flixel users make their first game ever in Flixel.

Flixel Community was born as a healthy fork of Flixel. It is not supposed to replace Flixel or to compete with it, but to co-exist. [Adam](http://twitter.com/AdamAtomic) (Flixel's author) encouraged us to grow a community version and maintain it to our heart's content, even offering it as an alternative to Flixel.
